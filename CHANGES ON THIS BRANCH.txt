# refactor structure - divide and compartmentalise objects such as players and characters etc
	## allow for abstraction away from LOVE basics and core functions
	## increase fidelity of control over objects and getting info about them
	## allow for a more logical, calmer, more intuitive game update and draw logic
	## overall allow "active game code" to be a bit tidier

# implement system for "stepping" - time-bound/gated inputs
